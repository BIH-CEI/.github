# Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability 

<hr>

We transform the global health ecosystem through the power of interoperable information and technology

## [International Standards](https://www.bihealth.org/en/research/scientific-infrastructure/core-units/interoperability/home/translate-to-englisch-standards)
Digital medicine is at the centre of new developments as an interface and is thus central to the networking not only of machines, but also of knowledge and people. It generates significant benefits in translational research.  Large amounts of medical data are available in different systems, but merging them is technically and semantically challenging: data is stored by the systems in their proprietary formats. These formats have to be forwarded and 'translated' via communication servers before they get integrated into a central platform, such as the Health Data Platform. This results in errors and often also a time delay due to the lack of interfaces and uniform semantics.

Therefore, the mission of the Core Unit eHealth and Interoperability is to equip data with the following international IT standards:
